# Chat App using Sveltekit and Firebase

This is a personal project I created to learn about sveltekit and integration of Firebase with Sveltekit. This is a basic chat applications with some advance features like real time chat translation.

# About Svelte and why I chose it

I made this project to learn about svelte. Personally I find svelte an amazing framework, after having some experience with react which uses virtual DOM for rendering HTML, svelte felt like a fresh start which actually compiles all the bundle into a single js file. Svelte has some amazing in-built features like stores, transitions etc.

Sveltekit included Svelte with some cherry on the top features like file based routing system, Server side files, Layout files, and server files to create standalone API's.

Although svelte may not be mature yet and may not have a vast community like react, but it will grow a lot in future. It has a lot of space for improvement and it is definitely going to carry the web development market someday.

- Eslint : Code Analysis Tool
